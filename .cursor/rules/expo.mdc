"Use Expo's asset system for images and fonts",
"Implement proper error handling and crash reporting",
"Use the Expo <Link href=""> component for routing to pages"
"API routes are named filename+api.ts",
"Use Expo Router's APIs for navigation, such as `useRouter()`.",

1. Use TypeScript for type safety
2. Implement proper styling using StyleSheet
3. Utilize Expo's vector icons
4. Use Expo's secure store for sensitive data
5. Follow React Native best practices for performance
   `;

## Expo SDK Usage

- Prefer Expo's built-in components and APIs over third-party libraries whenever possible.
- Use Expo's asset system for managing images and fonts.
- Use `expo-permissions` to handle device permissions gracefully.

- **Code Structure:**
  - Use functional components with hooks.
  - Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility.
  - Use Typescript for type safety and better code maintainability.

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Variables and functions: camelCase (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
  - Directories: lowercase hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
